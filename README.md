# Why learn React Native?

React has changed how we built web apps. Just declare components, and all UI is now just a function of a state. Change a state and the UI updates seamlessly. With React Native, you can do the same for both iOS and Android native apps. No web view involved. Learn once, write for all three platforms. The holy grail of broad-stack UI development.
